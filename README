High-performance UDP traffic generator for Windows with real-time statistics.  
Designed for engineers, testers, and developers who need to measure network performance, latency, jitter, and packet loss at scale.

For testing an learning purposes, not intended to be use on any comercial application.

## üöÄ Features

- Multi-threaded high-performance UDP sender
- Live statistics every 10 seconds (TX/RX, latency, jitter, packet loss)
- Supports rate control in **Mbps** or **PPS**
- Configurable payload size and pattern generation
- Optional packet verification (echo mode)
- Token bucket shaper for accurate traffic rate
- Works smoothly on **Windows**

## üß† How It Works

The script sends UDP packets containing a sequence number and timestamp header.  
If a responder (loopback or echo server) sends them back, latency and jitter are calculated.  
It uses a token bucket algorithm to regulate bandwidth and achieve consistent traffic rates.

A responder script is provided as well.
